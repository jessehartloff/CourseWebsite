== Academic Integrity

<br/>
CSE Department Academic Integrity Policy: <a href="http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/undergrad/policy_academic.php">http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/undergrad/policy_academic.php</a>

<br/><br/>
Course Academic Integrity Policy: Do not represent work as your own if you did not write it.
<br/><br/>
All violations will be result in:
<br/><br/>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <div class="text-center alert alert-danger">
            <h3 style="color:red">An F in CSE442.</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-8"></div>
</div>
<br/>
It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
have been caught.

<br/><br/>
Examples of acceptable behavior:
<ul>
    <li>Searching the Internet for coding help and examples.</li>
    <li>Using libraries in your project.</li>
    <li>Contributing to an existing project.</li>
</ul>


Examples of <b>un</b>acceptable behavior:
<ul>
    <li>Copying a large amount of code into your project without crediting the source.</li>
    <li>Allowing someone outside your group to write code for your project and representing it as the groups
        work.
    </li>
    <li>Violating the licensing agreement of publicly available code.</li>
</ul>


== Course Structure

<p>
    This course is focused on producing and deploying functional software and will focus on a semester-long
    group project. The course will be taught in a lab
    environment while you work on your project instead of as a series of traditional lectures. We will use
    lecture time to discuss projects, give
    guidance, and provide the assistance and knowledge needed to complete your project. In this way, the
    material can be taught as it applies to your project and tailored to your specific needs.
</p>

== Grading

<br/>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    There is no curve for this course. Letter grades are determined by an absolute scale.
</div>

<p>
    Final letter grades will be determined by the following cutoffs:

    <tr>
        <td>60-64</td>
        <td>A</td>

</table>

<br/>

<div><h4>Group Project</h4></div>

<p>
    The following 8 criteria will be graded for the group project with each graded 0-4 for a total of 32
    potential points. The project will be tracked through 4 "sprints" following the scrum methodology. Each
    sprint will be 3 weeks long and will result in functioning code with increasing functionality as the
    project progresses.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Sprint 1 Progress</li>
    <li>Sprint 2 Progress</li>
    <li>Sprint 2 Video Submission</li>
    <li>Sprint 3 Progress</li>
    <li>Sprint 4 Progress</li>
    <li>Sprint 4 Video Submission</li>
    <li>Presentation</li>
    <li>Deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <b>Sprint Progress</b> will be assessed by the groups productivity and professionalism throughout the
    sprint. To earn full credit the group must make progress on the project, have a deliverable to show the
    customer, attend meetings and use acceptable software engineering practices including proper branching
    and task tracking with a scrum board.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Sprint Videos</b> are short demonstrations of your software that are posted to YouTube. These videos
    should be made to appeal to a wide audience and should not be very technical nor should they show any
    code. The specific nature of
    these videos are largely dependent on the specific project and should be appropriate for your
    software. Examples of videos can be found on the project page from the previous version of this course
    <a href="http://ub-cse.github.io/CSE442-Fall2015-Projects.html">
        http://ub-cse.github.io/CSE442-Fall2015-Projects.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Presentations</b> are live demonstrations of your project to the class. These presentations can
    include a demonstration of the software as well as a technical description of how it works.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Deployment</b> means that by the end of the semester your project must be made publicly available to
    anyone interested in using it. Note that this does not imply that you must release the source code for
    your project and you are free to monetize your project. If you choose to monetize, interested investors
    and/or customers must have a way to give you money by the end of the semester to earn full credit for
    deployment.
</p><p>
    Examples of what can be accepted for deployment if your group chooses to monetize include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Release your software for sale on a publicly available platform</li>
    <li>Start a crowd sourced project</li>
    <li>Deliver a VC pitch to potential investors</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Examples of what can be accepted for deployment if your group chooses <b>not</b> to monetize include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Release your software for free on a publicly available platform</li>
    <li>Host your source code in a public repository with clear and accurate documentation installation
        instructions
    </li>
    <li>Submit a research paper based on results produced by your software to a research conference or
        journal
    </li>
    <li>Build and deliver finished software to a non-paying customer who has been working with the
        group throughout the development process
    </li>
</ul>


<div><h4>Individual Assessment</h4></div>

<p>
    Show your ability write software and interact with others who write software.
</p>
<p>
    The individual assessment
    will be largely open-ended with the potential to earn up to 32 points. There
    will be a variety of opportunities to earn these points throughout the semester and there will be
    choices in how these points can be earned, but the total individual points will be capped at 32.
</p>

<p>
    A sample of ways to earn these points is given below. You are encouraged to add to this list with your
    own suggestions that fit the criteria that it shows your ability write software and interact with others
    who write software. Point values may vary depending on activity with a
    default value of 8.
    Activities can be repeated multiple times for credit but no more than 16 points can come from the same
    activity.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Present a coding topic of your choosing to the class</li>
    <li>Assist another group with their project</li>
    <li>Contribute to a Wikipedia article related to software</li>
    <li>Contribute code to an open-source project</li>
    <li>Complete coding assignments (Will be announced when available)</li>
    <li>Interview for a software development internship or full-time position</li>
    <li>Receive an offer for a software development internship or full-time position</li>
    <li>Host a software-related video to YouTube</li>
    <li>Complete a software development internship (points awarded retroactively)</li>
    <li>Complete a software project outside of coursework that is substantial enough to put on your resume
        (points can be awarded retroactively)
    </li>
</ul>


<br/>
<div><h4>Grading Notes</h4></div>

All assignments are subject to the following conditions.

<ul>
    <li>No late submissions will be accepted. Late submissions will result in a grade of 0.</li>
    <li>Much of the grading in this course is subjective and final grading decisions are made at the

== Course Description

<p>
    This course will help bridge the gap between academia and industry through the experience of a semester
    long group software project. Students will learn a variety of software engineering concepts and
    realities while functioning as a software development team. Students will also learn the importance of
    continual career development through self-learning.
