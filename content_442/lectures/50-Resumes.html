<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Why write a resume?</h1>
<ul>
    <li>To get an interview</li>
    <ul>
        <li>A great resume can make the interview easier</li>
        <li>Don’t lie on your resume. They can tell in the interview</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning the claimed skills before the interview</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>You’re expected to</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Even if you have the job through a contact</li>
        <li>HR requires a resume to be on file</li>

</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Resume Content</h1>

    </ul>
    <li>Your resume is a document that represents you (professionally at least)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This is how you choose to present yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <li>If you sloppily present yourself on a document that you’ve had years to prepare:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>How much do you really care about your career?</li>
        <li>How are you going to represent the company?</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">As opposed to:</h1>
<h2>Make this document look great! Especially if you’re applying for any web/app design or any other front-end design.
    Your resume is a document that represents you (professionally at least). This is how you choose to present yourself.

        <li>Human resources</li>
        <li>An algorithm</li>

    <li>Software Engineers submit a job description to HR</li>
    <ul>
        <li>“We need someone who can work on our website and knows HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, JavaScript”</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Resumes are submitted to HR</li>
    <li>HR filters resumes not fitting the criteria</li>

    <li>*Potentially controversial suggestion:</li>
    <li> “Write your resume for you”</li>
    <ul>
        <li>If a company doesn’t like it, it might not have been the best match anyway</li>
        <li>Bad advice if you just want <i>a</i> job</li>
        <li>Better advice if you want your dream job</li>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">If you don’t know where you want to work</h1>
