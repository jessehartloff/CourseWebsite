[Monday - Let's just cool down after covering objects. Maybe have a review day]
[Wednesday - Importing a jar]
[Friday - Exporting jars. Packages]

[At some point, show them that they can see the whole java library in their IDE]


== Java Libraries

<p>
    Java itself, along with any programming language, does not have many directly useful features. Java provides the
    means for us to create variables and arrays of variables, control program flow with conditionals and loops, create
    classes and methods, and gives us a way to define a main method as a starting point for the execution of our code.
    These features are essential to the language, but with only these features it would be difficult to write useful
    programs. We would all find ourselves writing basic functionality that most developers will need. To save time we
    could share the classes and methods we write with others so they don't have to rewrite the same common
    functionality. This idea of sharing code is the fundamental concept behind libraries and a library is simply a
    collection of code that has been shared by its author(s).
</p>

<p>
    The most prominent library java code is the JRE System Library. This is the standard library for the language and it
    contains every class we've use so far in this course (String, ArrayList, HashMap, Files, Paths, Collections, etc).
    None of
    these classes are fundamentally part of the language and it would be possible to write a java program that doesn't
    use the JRE System Library at all. However, it's extremely useful to use this library instead writing a program from
    complete scratch. The authors of these classes made them available to us for free. Let's make use of them!
</p>
<p>
    In eclipse you can see the JRE System Library in your project folder and you can explore the multitudes of classes
    provided to us. Most of the common features we want are included in this library, but what if we want to do
    something that isn't built-in to this library? The straight-forward answer is "write it yourself", but this can be
    tedious at best if we're always writing programs that only use classes built-in to the JRE. In this section we will
    explore an alternate solution to writing everything ourselves. We will import libraries written by other developers
    and use their classes instead of writing our own.
</p>


== External Libraries

<p>
    We will use external libraries to use classes written by other developers. To do this we will import jar (Java
    ARchive) files that contain the classes we want to use. When a developer wants to release their code for other to
    use they can create a jar file of all their classes and share this archive, as opposed to sharing their .java files
    individually. We will add these jar files to our projects as external libraries and we'll have all the contained
    classes available in our programs. These classes can be used just the same as if the .java files were in the project
    directly, or if they were in the JRE library. There's no magic here. We're merely injecting someone else's classes
    into our program.
</p>

<p>
    Side note: When a program uses many external libraries it is useful to use build tools such as Maven, ant, or
    Groovy, but we will import the jar files directly in this course.
</p>

== Packages

<p>
    When adding external libraries it is important to be aware of the packages contained in these libraries. Packages
    are
    a way of organizing classes and functions similar to directory structures in a filesystem. Thus, the package is the
    location of a class. Using the package name along with the class name in called the classes fully-qualified name.
    This may seem a bit abstract so let's look at an example.
</p>

<p>
    We've been using the Class <code>ArrayList</code> throughout this course. This class is located in the package
    <code>java.util</code> making its fully-qualified name <code>java.util.ArrayList</code>. We can use ArrayLists with
    this fully-qualified name, but we commonly <code>import</code> the class and call it by its class name only. By
    adding the line <code>import java.util.ArrayList;</code> before our class definition we can use
    <code>ArrayList</code>
    without specifying it's package every time we use it. This is not required and the following is a valid complete
    program with no imports.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
public class NoImports{

    public static void main(String[] args){
        java.util.ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new java.util.ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        numbers.add(3);
        numbers.add(6);
        System.out.println(numbers.size());
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Though we tend to prefer the following:
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class WithImport{

    public static void main(String[] args){
        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        numbers.add(3);
        numbers.add(6);
        System.out.println(numbers.size());
    }

}
</code></pre>


<p>
    When using external libraries we have the same choice, though we do need to check the library to know which packages
    contain the classes we want to use. We can either import them and use the class name, or skip the import and use the
    fully-qualified name but either way we have to tell our program where to find the classes we want to use.
</p>

== CSE115 Library

<p>
    For the assignments this week we will use the CSE115 library. This is a small library with 3 classes:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>cse115.math.NormalDistribution</dt>
    <dd>Instances of this class store the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution and contains a method to
        determine the z-score of a provided value.
    </dd>
    <dt>cse115.math.Polynomial</dt>
    <dd>Objects of this class represent polynomials and contain several methods to analyze them.
    </dd>
    <dt>cse115.words.Words</dt>
    <dd>This class is a collection of static methods used for analyzing and comparing words. This class uses the CMU
        pronunciation dictionary and the Princeton parts of speech dictionaries for it's methods.
    </dd>
</dl>


<p>
    *** If you don't understand some of the concepts in this library you can still complete the assignments this week.
    A major advantage of using libraries is that you don't have to know how they work. If a question asks you to return
    a z-score and you find a method in a library that computes z-score, you can call that method with knowing a single
    thing about statistics. We have been taking advantage of this powerful idea throughout the semester. You don't need
    to understand how an ArrayList or HashMap is coded to use them to store values, You don't have to understand file
    systems to call Files.readAllLines, and next week you won't need to understand how the Internet works to make an
    HTTP request. Abstracting out these low-level details is what allows us to write complex programs.
</p>

<p>
    For the assignments this week you must look through these classes and read the methods that have been implemented,
    then call the methods needed to answer each question.
