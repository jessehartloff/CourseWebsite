== Functions

<a href="{% static "courses/115Slides/3-Functions.pptx" %}">Functions Concept Slides</a>
<br/><br/>
{#Slides#}

{#_technically_ you can do anything with what you now know (exaggeration, but not nearly as much as you'd think).#}
{#You have at your disposal what's called a turing complete language, a language that can do anything that can be#}
{#done by any computer. Everything else we will do in this course will be exploring what can be done with this power.#}
{#Much of this will include using code that other people have written.. but how to use their code? They package them in#}
{#methods and we call their code.#}

<p>
    Functions provide a way for us to store lines of code to be used later. The code stored in a function can be reused
    as many times as we'd like making functions a great way to store commonly needed code and using whenever it's
    needed without having to rewrite, or even revisit, the code. Taking this one step further, it also allows us to
    easily share code with others. If someone has shared a function that does what we need, we can use that function
    instead of writing our own code to do the same thing. In this case, we don't even have to think about how to solve
    the problem. We just use the function that is available to us.
</p>

<p>Functions allow us to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reuse code</li>
    <li>Ignore details</li>
    <li>Organize code</li>
    <li>Get more done faster</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>We don't always a function to perform the exact same action every time it's called. For instance, what if we want to
    write a function to compute the cube of any given number. Here we will use parameters (input variables) in the
    function to get the value of the number to cube.</p>
<p>
    A function must be correct on every possible input value.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Return value</h4>
<p>
    Functions can optionally return a value. This value is given back to whomever called the function. In the example
    above, the cube of the input would be returned to the caller.
</p>
{##}
{#Reuse functions. Programmers are lazy/efficient.#}
{##}
{#So we can think at a higher level and ignore some details.#}
{#To start a car. Sit down, insert key, turn key.. no. Just start the car#}
{##}
{#Have a piece of code that we often? Put it in a function! Then use it anywhere in your code.#}
{##}
{#Lets you stay focused on writing software without always thinking about how every single piece is working.#}
{#Write it once, use it often.#}
{##}
{#Helps us organize code.#}
{##}
{#Like variables, but stores code instead of a value. Code is inserted into you program inside a separate block when a#}
{#function is called.#}
{##}
{#Must be correct on all inputs#}

== Methods

<p>We are covering the concept of functions, but there are no functions in java! Don't panic, we will still use
    everything we're learning about functions but in java we will apply our knowledge to methods.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Method</b>: A procedure defined within a class.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In java every line of code we write is part of a class, with very few exceptions. Since all our code is contained
    within a class we are writing methods, not functions.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Calling a method</h4>

<p>
    There are many different ways to call a method. We will analyze this common format first.
</p>

<pre>
[variable name] = methodName([arguments]);
</pre>


<ul>
    <li><b>variable name</b>: The variable where the return value of the method will be stored</li>
    <li><b>methodName</b>: The name of the method to be called</li>
    <li><b>arguments</b>: The inputs to the method. The order of the arguments is important.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<pre>
[variable name] = [class].methodName([arguments]);
</pre>
<pre>
[variable name] = [object].methodName([arguments]);
</pre>

<p>
    In this lesson we will call methods that are part of a class (Math) or part of an object (String instance). In
    these cases we will use the dot operator (.) to access the methods of the class/object.
</p>


{#We've been using one method all along. void System.out.println(String text); or just println.#}
{#System.out is called the package.#}


== Math Methods

<p>
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#method_summary">Math Methods</a>
</p>

<p>
    Java provides a variety of methods to perform common mathematical operations contained in the Math class. We will
    see a few example methods below. See the link above for a full reference of methods in the Math class.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Square Root</h4>
<p>
    Math.sqrt(double input) returns the square root of the input double.
</p>
<pre>
    double input = 9.0;
    double result = Math.sqrt(input);
    System.out.println(result);
</pre>

<p>
    Output: <kbd>3.0</kbd>
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Absolute Value</h4>
<p>
    Math.abs(double input) returns the square root of the input double. The abs method will also work with int,
    long, and float types.
</p>
<pre>
    double input = 9.0;
    double negativeInput = -9.0;
    double result = Math.abs(input);
    double negativeResult = Math.abs(negativeInput);
    System.out.println(result);
    System.out.println(negativeResult);
</pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>9.0<br/>9.0</kbd>


<p>
    Absolute value is useful for distance calculations. Here we compute the distance between two numbers with the same
    result regardless of the order of the subtraction. This allows us to compute distance even if we don't know which
    value is larger.
</p>
<pre>
    double a = 15.0;
    double b = 10.0;
    double distance = Math.abs(a-b);
    double reverseDistance = Math.abs(b-a);
    System.out.println(distance);
    System.out.println(reverseDistance);
</pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>5.0<br/>5.0</kbd>


<hr/>
<h4>Exponentiation</h4>
<p>
    Math.pow(double a, double b) return a raised to the b power. This method takes 2 inputs separated by a comma and
    their order is important.
</p>
<pre>
    double base = 2.0;
    double exponent = 8.0;
    double result = Math.pow(base, exponent);
    System.out.println(result);
</pre>

<p>
    Output: <kbd>256.0</kbd>
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Random Number Generator (RNG)</h4>

<p>
    Math.random() will return a pseudo-random double between 0.0 and 1.0.
</p>

<pre>
    if(Math.random() > 0.5){
        System.out.println("There is a 50% chance this line will be printed");
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Each time the above is executed there will be a 50% chance that the String value will be printed to the console.
</p>
<p>What if we don't want a value in the range 0.0-1.0? What if we want a value from 0.0-100.0? We'll multiply the
    result!</p>

<pre>
    double randomNumber = Math.random()*100;
    System.out.println("The random value is: " + randomNumber);
</pre>

<p>The output will be a random double between 0.0 and 100.0</p>


== String Methods

<p>
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#method_summary">String Methods</a>
</p>

<p>
    The String methods are slightly different that Math methods in that they are called on a specific instance of a
    String value using the . operator (dot operator). This means we must have a String in our control to use these
    methods. Below are a few common String methods. See the link above for a complete list of String methods.
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Length</h4>
<p>
    length() returns the number of characters in the String. This includes spaces and other white space characters.
</p>
<pre>
    String input = "a String";
    int inputLength = input.length();
    System.out.println(inputLength);
</pre>

<p>
    Output: <kbd>8</kbd>
</p>


<hr/>
<h4>Contains</h4>
<p>
    contains(String pattern) returns true if the String contains pattern as a sub string, false otherwise.
</p>
<pre>
    String url = "buffalo.edu";
    System.out.println(url.contains(".com");
    System.out.println(url.contains(".edu");
</pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>false<br/>true</kbd>


<hr/>
<h4>Lower Case</h4>
<p>
    toLowerCase() returns a copy of the String in all lower case letters. Note that this method does not change the
    value of the String itself.
</p>
<pre>
    String input = "STOP YELLING";
    String output = input.toLowerCase();
    System.out.println(input);  // The original value is unchanged
    System.out.println(output); // The method call returns the lowercase String
</pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>STOP YELLING<br/>stop yelling</kbd>


== Defining Methods

<p>
    Method definition:
</p>
<pre>
[access] [return type] methodName([parameters]){
  [body]
 }
</pre>

<dl>
    <dt>access</dt>
    <dd>Determines how the method can be accessed. We will explore different levels of access when we explore classes.
        For now, we've been using "static" which allows us to call the method without creating an instance of the class
        (object).
    </dd>
    <dt>return type</dt>
    <dd>The type of the variable returned by the method. The method must contain a return statement with a value of
        this type. If the return type is "void" the method doesn't return a value and can omit the return statement.
    </dd>
    <dt>methodName</dt>
    <dd>The name used to call the method.</dd>
    <dt>parameters</dt>
    <dd>Comma-separated list of the methods input variables.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
    Calling a method:
</p>
<pre>
    methodName([arguments])
</pre>
<dl>
    <dt>methodName</dt>
    <dd>The name used to define the method.</dd>
    <dt>arguments</dt>
    <dd>Comma-separated list of the methods input values. The values will assigned to the parameters in the method
        definition. The types and order must match between the arguments and parameters.
    </dd>
    <dt>return value</dt>
    <dd>A method call is an expression that evaluates to a value matching the return type of the method. This is the
        value that is returned with the <code>return</code> keyword inside the body of the method.
    </dd>
</dl>


<hr/>

<p>
    Let's examine a java program and trace through its execution.
</p>

<pre>
    static int myMethod(int input){
        int result = input*10;
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){
        int returnValue = myMethod(5);
        System.out.println(returnValue);
    }
</pre>

<p>
    Output: <kbd>50</kbd>
</p>

<br/><br/>
<p>Breakdown:</p>
<ol>
    <li><code>public static void main(String[] args){</code> Execution starts with the main method</li>
    <li><code>int returnValue = myMethod(5);</code> The right side of the equal sign need to be evaluated to a single
        int value
    </li>
    <li><code>myMethod(5)</code> Look for a method named myMethod and call it with an argument of 5 as an int</li>
    <li><code>static int myMethod(int input){</code> Shift control to myMethod to resolve the method call</li>
    <li><code>int input = 5;</code> <b>The hidden line</b>. Create an int variable, name it input, and assign it the
        argument value of 5
    </li>
    <li><code>int result = input*10;</code> Create an int variable, name it result, and assign it the result of input*10
    </li>
    <li><code>int result = 5*10;</code></li>
    <li><code>int result = 50;</code></li>
    <li><code>return result;</code> Return the value of result back to the main method</li>
    <li><code>return 50;</code> *The return value must match the return type from the method header</li>
    <li><code>int returnValue = 50;</code> Back in the main method, the call to myMethod(5) is replaced by its return
        value. All variable declared within the method fall out of scope and are destroyed
    </li>
    <li><code>System.out.println(returnValue);</code> Print the value of returnValue</li>
    <li><code>System.out.println(50);</code></li>
    <li><code>System.out.println("50");</code></li>
    <li><code>}</code> The end of the main method is reached and the program ends</li>
</ol>

{#-Void with no parameters (I want to print this message whenever called)#}
{#-Void with parameters (Print hello to the parameter) (the hidden lines of code)#}
{#-Non-void with parameters (Simple math method)#}
{#-Multiple parameters. Stress the order.#}
{#-Non-void without parameters? Foreshadow getters?#}
{##}
{#Scope. Parameters don't exist outside the method.#}
{##}
{#method stores all the fixed code. Parameters are the only part that might change.#}

== Multiple Parameters

<p>
    If a method requires multiple parameters, their types and names are given as a comma-separated list. It is important
    to note the order of these parameters when calling a method with multiple parameters.
</p>

<pre>
    static int subtract(int firstParameter, int secondParameter){
        return firstParameter - secondParameter;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println(subtract(5,3));
        System.out.println(subtract(3,5));
    }
</pre>

<p>
    Output: </p>
<kbd>2<br/>-2</kbd>

<p>
    In the case of calling <code>subtract(5,3)</code> there are now 2 hidden lines of code that executed before running
    the method's code, <code>int firstParameter = 5;</code> and <code>int secondParameter = 3;</code>.
</p>
<p>
    When calling <code>subtract(3,5)</code> the hidden lines are <code>int firstParameter = 3;</code> and <code>int
    secondParameter = 5;</code>.
</p>

<p>A method may contain any number of parameters, even 0. Many of the early methods in this course didn't have any
    parameters and took the form of <code>Q1()</code>. Even with no parameters, method calls and definitions must
    include the parentheses. In this way Java can distinguish between a method with no parameters, and a variable name.
</p>

== void

<p>
    Defining a method with a return type of void means the method doesn't return anything when it is called. These are
    typically methods that perform an action, as opposed to computing a value. An example of a method with return type
    void is <code>System.out.println</code>. We use his method to print text to the screen for the user to read and we
    don't need any return value.
</p>

<p>
    When defining methods with a void return type, including a return statement is optional. If a return statement is
    used in a void method it must be used with no value <code>return;</code> and functions similar to
    <code>break;</code> in a loop in that it immediately exits the function call and returns control to the calling
    method.
</p>

{#== Code Style#}
{##}
{#Using methods is essential to writing readable/debuggable code. Large programs that don't use methods are messy.#}
{##}
{#Example code. Identify which parts could benefit from being methods and factor out that code.#}
