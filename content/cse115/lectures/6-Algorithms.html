== Algorithms

<p>
    We now know the fundamental concepts of programming (Variables, Control Flow, Functions) and we know how to access
    and store data (Data Structures, Files). Now we will process this data by training computers to extract certain
    information from the data through algorithms.
</p>


== Significant Values

<p>
    First we will explore several algorithms to extract information from a data structure. We will explore finding the
    average value contained in a data structure as well as the maximum and minimum values it contains.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>
    Average
</h4>

<p>
    We have seen how to compute the sum of a data structure. Let's take that concept one step further and find the
    average by dividing by the number of values in the structure.
</p>
<pre>
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    numbers.add(1);
    numbers.add(2);
    numbers.add(2);
    numbers.add(2);

    int sum = 0;
    for(int value : numbers){
        sum += value;
    }

    double average = sum*1.0/numbers.size();
    System.out.println(average);
</pre>
<p>
    Output: <kbd>1.75</kbd>
</p>

<p>
    Here we see that we iterate over the ArrayList while adding to a running sum. After the loop, we divide the sum by
    the number of values to find the average.
</p>
<p>
    Note that <code>sum</code> and <code>numbers.size()</code> are both
    integers and dividing them directly would perform integer division which would drop the decimal and return 1 instead
    of 1.75. A simple way to avoid this is by first multiplying the sum by the double 1.0 (not 1) which will convert the
    sum to a
    double without changing the value. Since the division is now a double divided an int the result will be a double.
</p>

<hr/>
<h4>
    Maximum Value
</h4>

<p>
    The next algorithm we will see is finding the most significant value in a data structure. We will introduce this
    concept by finding the maximum value, though the concept can be applied to any measure of significance.
</p>

{#<pre>#}
{#    [initialize element]#}
{#    [initialize value]#}
{#    [iterate while updating the most significant element/value]#}
{#    [return the most significant element/value]#}
{#</pre>#}

<pre>
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    numbers.add(32);
    numbers.add(79);
    numbers.add(100);
    numbers.add(53);

    int max = 0;
    for(int value : numbers){
        if(value > max){
            max = value;
        }
    }
    System.out.println(max);
</pre>
<p>
    Output: <kbd>100</kbd>
</p>

<p>
    Here we can see the typical steps to find the most significant value in a data structure. First, we initialize a
    variable that will store the maximum. Then we iterate over the data structure while checking if each value is is the
    largest we've seen so far. If it is, store it in max. After iterating through all the data, max will be storing the
    maximum value of the entire data structure.
</p>

<p>
    However, there is something that can go wrong with this code. It works for the data provided, but consider what it
    would find for the max value in the following ArrayList.
</p>

<pre>
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    numbers.add(-32);
    numbers.add(-79);
    numbers.add(-100);
    numbers.add(-53);
</pre>

<p>
    If we run our code to find max value on this ArrayList it will return 0 when it should return -32. Our mistake is
    initializing the max value to be higher than the actual max in the data. Care must be taken to make sure this
    doesn't happen which can be tricky when writing methods with unknown inputs. To avoid these issues we will
    initialize max to be so small that it can't possibly interfere with the data. We do this by using constants provided
    by java for purposes like these.
</p>

<pre>
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    numbers.add(-32);
    numbers.add(-79);
    numbers.add(-100);
    numbers.add(-53);

    int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    for(int value : numbers){
        if(value > max){
            max = value;
        }
    }
    System.out.println(max);
</pre>
<p>
    Output: <kbd>-32</kbd>
</p>

<p>
    Here we use java's Integer.MIN_VALUE constant to initialize max to the smallest possible value that can be stored in
    an int. This allows to us to find the true max of the ArrayList. This constant is an actual number that is stored in
    max. We can print out this value to see the limits of int values.
</p>
<pre>
    int minValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    System.out.println(minValue);
    int maxValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    System.out.println(maxValue);
</pre>
<p>
    Output: </p>
<kbd>-2147483648<br/>2147483647</kbd>

<p>
    It is important to note that an int cannot store values outside of this range. Attempting to do so will cause
    odd behaviour. For example.
</p>
<pre>
    int maxValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    System.out.println(maxValue);
    System.out.println(maxValue+1);
</pre>
<p>
    Output: </p>
<kbd>2147483647<br/>-2147483648</kbd>

<p>
    We see that going above the max value of an int will "wrap around" to the min value. When this happens in software
    it can cause many errors that are difficult to debug.
</p>

<p>
    When finding maximum and minimum values we will use the following constants:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Integer.MIN_VALUE</dt>
    <dd>The minimum value that can be stored in an int (-2147483648)</dd>
    <dt>Integer.MAX_VALUE</dt>
    <dd>The maximum value that can be stored in an int (2147483647)</dd>
    <dt>Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY</dt>
    <dd>The greatest magnitude negative number that can be stored in a double</dd>
    <dt>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</dt>
    <dd>The largest value that can be stored in a double</dd>
</dl>

<p>
    Note that doubles can store much larger numbers than int, though they lose accuracy due to truncation. Also, there
    is a MIN_VALUE for doubles, but it stores the smallest positive value that a double can store.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
    When we are not only concerned with the maximum value, but also want to know what index stores that value we can
    track both pieces of information. Now when we update the max value found we will also update the index where it was
    found.
</p>
<pre>
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    numbers.add(0);
    numbers.add(-47);
    numbers.add(92);
    numbers.add(-3);

    int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    int index = -1;
    for(int i=0; i < numbers.size(); i++){
        if(numbers.get(i) > max){
            max = numbers.get(i);
            index = i;
        }
    }
    System.out.println("The max value of " + max + " was found at index " + index);
</pre>
<p>
    Output: <kbd>The max value of 92 was found at index 2</kbd>
</p>

<p>
    Following the same concept as for max and min value, we initialize the index to impossible value (-1). This is not a
    proper index and will be overwritten once the first value is read. By using -1 we can also check for this value
    elsewhere in the code if we have concerns that there might be an error. For example, if you initialize the index to
    -1 in a method that returns an index we can check if it returns -1 when it's called and know if something went wrong
    (ex. the data structure was empty).
</p>


== Linear Search

<p>
    Search: Does a given data structure contain a particular element?
</p>

<p>
    This is a question we have to answer very often when writing software. We will see two different algorithms to
    answer this question. First, linear search which iterates over the data and checks every element for equality one at
    a time. If any element is equal to the value we are looking for, return true. If every single element is checked and
    the value is not found, we can conclude that the value is not in the data structure and we can return false.
</p>

<pre>
public static boolean linearSearch(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers, int toFind){
    for(int value : numbers){
        if(value == toFind){
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

public static void main(String[] args){
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; squares = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    for(int i=1; i<100; i++){
        squares.add(i*i);
    }
    System.out.println(linearSearch(squares, 9));
    System.out.println(linearSearch(squares, 23));
}
</pre>

<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>true<br/>false</kbd>

<p>
    In this main method we populate an ArrayList with the first 100 perfect squares and search for 2 different values.
    Since 9 is a perfect square, the method finds it in the ArrayList and returns true. Likewise, 23 is not a perfect
    square so the search checks every element without finding 23 and returns false after the loop concludes.
</p>


== Runtime

<p>
    Would you visit a website that did everything you ever wanted, but took a full minute to load or refresh? Would you
    play the greatest game ever made if it lagged constantly? It's not always enough to write software that works. We
    also have to be concerned with the efficiency of our programs. While there are many different types of efficiency to
    consider, we will only analyze runtime here. As you
    progress through computer science you will become increasingly aware of the efficiency of the software you write.
</p>

<p>
    Example: Movie graphics are much higher quality than video game graphics not because they have better technology,
    but because they can spend much more time letting their algorithms render their models instead of the 1/30
    or 1/60 of a second games have to render a frame in real time. Rendering high quality graphics in such a limited
    time requires highly sophisticated algorithms as well as powerful hardware.
</p>


== Binary Search

<p>
    Example Repository: <a href="https://github.com/hartloff/Search.git">https://github.com/hartloff/Search.git</a>
</p>

<p>
    Linear search found the correct answer, but can we find the value faster? What if have a large data set that we need
    to search frequently? We don't want to visit every element of the data to search for a particular value. We'll now
    see binary search which is an search algorithm that takes advantage of the structure of a sorted data structure.
    Note that if the data is not sorted, linear search is the most efficient way to find a particular element, but if
    the data is sorted we can drastically reduce the runtime of finding an element.
</p>

<p>
    Binary search follows these general steps when looking for a value we'll call <var>x</var>:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Initialize the lower and upper bounds of the search space to the first and last elements respectively</li>
    <li>Compare the middle element of the search space to <var>x</var></li>
    <ul>
        <li>If <var>x</var> is equal to the middle element, return true</li>
        <li>If <var>x</var> is greater than the middle element, set the lower bound equal to the middle element</li>
        <li>If <var>x</var> is less than the middle element, set the upper bound equal to the middle element</li>
        <li>Continue comparing <var>x</var> with the middle element until either <var>x</var> is found or the search
            space is empty
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>If the search space is empty without finding <var>x</var>, return false</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The key to this algorithm that it takes advantage of the sorted order, and the transitive property, to cut the
    search space in half each time the middle element is compared with <var>x</var>. Since the data is sorted, we know
    that the center element is greater than, or equal to, every element that come before it. Then if <var>x</var> is
    greater than the middle element, we know that it must be greater than all element in the first half of the data. In
    just 1 comparison we can eliminate half of the possible location of <var>x</var> and move our lower bound to the
    middle of the search space with confidence. Likewise, if <var>x</var> is less that the middle element we know it
    must be less that every element in the second half of the search space. We repeatedly check the middle element while
    reducing the search space in half until we either find <var>x</var> and return true, or run out of possible
    locations and return false.
</p>


<pre>
public static boolean binarySearch(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers, int toFind){
    if(numbers.size() == 0){
        return false;
    }

    int lowerBound = 0;
    int upperBound = numbers.size() - 1;

    // check the end points first
    if(numbers.get(lowerBound) == toFind || numbers.get(upperBound) == toFind){
        return true;
    }

    while(upperBound - lowerBound > 1){
        // Dividing 2 ints so this is integer division and returns the floor of the result
        int midPoint = (upperBound + lowerBound) / 2;
        int midValue = numbers.get(midPoint);

        if(midValue == toFind){
            return true;
        }else if(toFind < midValue){
            upperBound = midPoint;
        }else{
            // It's not equal to or less than so it must be greater than
            lowerBound = midPoint;
        }
    }

    return false;
}
</pre>

<p>
    Binary search is fast, but it assumed that the values in the ArrayList were sorted. To be able to use binary search
    we must first sort our data.
</p>

<pre>
public static void main(String[] args){
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; squares = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    for(int i=1; i<100; i++){
        squares.add(i*i);
    }
    System.out.println(binarySearch(squares, 9));
    System.out.println(binarySearch(squares, 23));
}
</pre>
<p>
    Output:
</p>
<kbd>true<br/>false</kbd>

<p>
    In this example we are careful to make sure the ArrayList contains sorted data, but what if we have unsorted data?
    If we know we'll have to search the data often we will consider sorting the ArrayList so we can use binary search.
</p>

{#<p>#}
{#    Great.. so we wrote a lot more code to do the same thing and added a constraint that the data must be sorted.#}
{#</p>#}

== Sort

{#<p>#}
{#    Binary search was cool, but we need to be sorted first#}
{#</p>#}
{##}

<p>
    For programming assignments in this course you can use java's built in sort method to sort data.
</p>

<pre>
    Collections.sort(data);
</pre>

<pre>
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; data = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    data.add(5);
    data.add(1);
    data.add(8);
    data.add(3);

    System.out.println(data);
    Collections.sort(data);
    System.out.println(data);
</pre>

<p>
    Output: </p>
<kbd>[5, 1, 8, 3]<br/>[1, 3, 5, 8]</kbd>


<p>
    Note that a HashMap does not maintain it's data in a meaningful order and thus cannot be sorted. However, we can
    sort ArrayLists which do preserve the order of its elements. This order is reflected by the index for each value.
    For example, the element at index 3 is always the 4th element in the ordering. By rearranging the elements we can
    achieve sorted order in an ArrayList.
</p>


<p>
    Collections.sort works with Strings too!
</p>

<pre>
    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; words = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    words.add("wing");
    words.add("coach");
    words.add("kettle");
    words.add("camp");

    System.out.println(words);
    Collections.sort(words);
    System.out.println(words);
</pre>

<p>
    Output: </p>
<kbd>[wing, coach, kettle, camp]<br/>[camp, coach, kettle, wing]</kbd>

<p>
    Sorting Strings does not always behave how you might expect since the characters are ordered by their
    <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII</a> values. One important aspect of this is that every capital letter
    will be ordered before any lower-case letter as shown in the following example.
</p>

<pre>
    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; words = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    words.add("Wing");
    words.add("cOach");
    words.add("kettle");
    words.add("camp");

    System.out.println(words);
    Collections.sort(words);
    System.out.println(words);
</pre>

<p>
    Output: </p>
<kbd>[Wing, cOach, kettle, camp]<br/>[Wing, cOach, camp, kettle]</kbd>

<p>
    If we're not thinking in terms of ASCII values, this is not the ordering we would expect. We must be aware of this
    and plan accordingly.
</p>

<br/>
<hr/>

<h3>Custom Sorting</h3>

<p>
    Since we don't always want to sort data from smallest to largest, we need a way to define different orderings. We'll
    see an example of ignoring case when sorting Strings to address the behaviour from the previous example.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Note: This example is included for completeness only. It contains several concepts that we have not yet covered so
    this is beyond the current expectation of the course.
</div>

<pre>
    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; words = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    words.add("Wing");
    words.add("cOach");
    words.add("kettle");
    words.add("camp");

    System.out.println(words);

    Collections.sort(words, new Comparator&lt;String&gt;(){
        @Override
        public int compare(String o1, String o2){
            return o1.compareToIgnoreCase(o2);
        }
    });

    System.out.println(words);
</pre>

<p>
    Output: </p>
<kbd>[Wing, cOach, kettle, camp]<br/>[camp, cOach, kettle, Wing]</kbd>

<p>
    Within the compare method we can define any ordering we chose. Sorting decisions will be made based on the return
    value of compare. If compare returns 0 the inputs are treated as equal, if it returns a negative value the first
    parameter (o1) is smaller than the second (o2), and if it returns a positive value o1 is larger than o2. In this
    example, the compareToIgnoreCase method follows these conditions.
</p>

== Selection Sort

<p>
    Example Repository: <a href="https://github.com/hartloff/Sort.git">https://github.com/hartloff/Sort.git</a>
</p>

<p>
    Beyond this course it will be important to understand how to sort data, even if you're not writing your own
    sorting methods. This understanding will helps us make more informed design decision when writing software. To this
    end, let's explore how we could sort data with our own method by implementing a sorting algorithm called selection
    sort.
</p>


<pre>
public static void selectionSort(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers){
    for(int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++){

        // Find the min value from index i to numbers.size()-1
        int minValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int minIndex = -1;
        for(int j = i; j < numbers.size(); j++){
            int currentValue = numbers.get(j);
            if(currentValue < minValue){
                minValue = currentValue;
                minIndex = j;
            }
        }

        // swap the values in i and minIndex
        numbers.set(minIndex, numbers.get(i));
        numbers.set(i, minValue);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the smallest unsorted element and adding to a sorted portion of the data
    structure. All the data begins unsorted, so the algorithm first finds the minimum value of all the data and swaps
    it with the value in index 0. Putting this value in index 0 starts the sorted portion of the the data. We know this
    minimum value end up in index 0, so we put it there and never visit index 0 again. We then look at the remaining
    elements, find the minimum value among them, and put that value in index 1. Now the first 2 elements are sorted and
    we only consider the elements from index 2 to the end of the list. We continue to find the minimum value in the
    unsorted portion and adding it to the sorted portion until the entire data set is sorted.
</p>

<p>
    Selection sort does sort the data, but it's quite slow. How can we sort data faster? Of course the answer is yes. In
    fact Collections.sort is much faster than selection sort. The bigger question is <em>how</em> can we sort faster?..
