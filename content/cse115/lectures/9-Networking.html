== The Internet

<p>
    We've seen many of the capabilities of computers and programming in this course, but realistically
</p>

<h4>
    the Internet is the reason why we carry computers in our pockets and backpacks.
</h4>

<p>
    Computers are significantly less interesting without the ability to connect to the Internet. Let's
    write code that connects our computers to the Internet.
</p>

{#Is great!#}
{#It's the reason why most of us carry tiny computers in our pocket. Computers have revolutionized the world over the #}
{#past 20 years, but they've been around a lot longer than that. They can crunch the hell out of numbers. Companies used #}
{#them to manage and process their data to streamline logistics, but what of the home PC? Word processing and games? #}
{#It wasn't until the Internet became common that the world changed. We can now communicate. Trying going a day without #}
{#Internet. Would you even touch your computer or smart phone? The fundamentals were ok, but let's get connected.#}


== HTTP

<p>
    HyperText Transfer Protocol. The language of the Internet.
</p>

{#<p>#}
{#    It is easy to think of the Internet as an incredible piece of technology that works via magic. The Internet is#}
{#    very physical.#}
{#</p>#}

<p>
    The Internet is massive collection of devices connected to the same network. Any device can send messages to any
    other connected device. Devices that are listening for messages are called servers, while devices sending messages
    and called clients. With so many devices "talking" to each other there is a need to standardize the way they
    communicate. Enter HTTP.
</p>

<p>
    HTTP is the protocol used to send messages between clients and servers. Each server on the Internet will be
    listening for HTTP requests from any client on the Internet. The full details of HTTP could fill an entire course,
    though for this course we will cover only 2 aspects of HTTP.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>
        HTTP GET Request
    </dt>
    <dd>
        A client will send a GET request to ask a server to send data back to the client in response. Every time we
        click a link we are sending a GET request to the server specified by that link. The response from the server is
        the requested web page.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        HTTP POST Request
    </dt>
    <dd>
        A client sends a POST request to send data to a server. POST requests are commonly use in web forms. When we
        fill out a form and click send, we are sending a POST request to a server containing the information we entered
        into the form.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    With these two types of requests we can ask a server for information and send information to a server. This enables
    2-way communication over the Internet.
</p>


== Web API's

<p>
    We typically interact with the internet by making HTTP GET
    requests
    through a web browser. The response of these GET requests is a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that tells
    the browser how to display the requested web page. These pages can contain links that we click to make a GET request
    for another page, or forms with buttons that make POST requests containing the data we enter. But what if want to
    interact with the Internet through the software we've written? What if we want to write a bot to automate posts on
    social
    media, an
    app to get the current weather and notify us if it's going to rain soon, display only text from blog posts without
    all the clutter, or watch the current bid on an online auction. All of these are possible with a little work, but it
    can be tedious to write code that reads pages made for humans. If you are interested in these applications search
    for tutorials about web crawlers and explore what you can do with you new programming skills.
</p>

<p>
    We won't explore web crawlers in this course, but there is another way to write software for the Internet by using
    Web APIs. A web API is a web application hosted on a server that is designed to be used directly through
    software instead of
    viewed in a browser. To this end, when a web API receives an HTTP request the response will only contain the
    requested data without complex formatting. This raw data will be in a standardized format that is easily parsed with
    software (ex. CSV, JSON). A web API will not return HTML, CSS, or Javascript. If it did, it would be a
    web site intended to be viewed through a browser. We will connect to web APIs via java programs to communicate over
    the Internet.
</p>


== The Library

<a href="https://hc.apache.org/">https://hc.apache.org/</a>

<p>
    We will use Apache's HttpComponents library to help us make HTTP requests over the Internet. This library contains
    a multitude of classes to explore, though we will only need to use a few of these for our purposes in this course.
</p>

<p>
    This library will be setup in the repository of any assignment for which it's required.
</p>
{#We'll use an external library with functions that help us to connect to the Internet.#}
{##}
{#Get HTML from a url#}
{#client-server#}
{#We need an HTTP client in our programs. The most common HTTP client software? Web browsers.#}
{##}


== HTTP GET

<p>
    To make an HTTP GET request using the Apache HttpComponents library we will use the following method. This method
    can be used directly in all of your assignments. This is one case where you can cut and paste this code wherever you
    need it.
</p>


<pre><code class="java">
public static String getRequest(String url){
    String response = "";

    try{
        response = Request.Get(url).execute().returnContent().asString();
    }catch(IOException ex){
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return response;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This method will use the library to connect to a url (link). The Request class from the library is used to send a GET
    request to the url and return the response as a String. As with files, connecting to a website can go wrong (ex. if
    an invalid link is used), so the method calls are wrapped in a try/catch block.
</p>

<p>
    Notice that 4 method calls are chained together in this method. This is a way of calling a method on the returned
    value of another method without having to store the intermediate results in variables. The static method Get
    returns an object of type Request which has a non-static method named execute which returns an object of type
    Response which has a non-static method named returnContent which returns an object of type Content which has a
    non-static method named asString. Through these calls the Request is created, executed to obtain a Response from the
    server, the Content is extracted from the response, then the Content is converted to a String which is returned to
    us for further processing.
</p>

== HTTP POST

<p>
    Similar to the get method this method will send a POST request with the provided params to the provided url. The
    params String is the data to be sent to the server identified by the url. This method
    can be used directly in all of your assignments. This is one case where you can cut and paste this code wherever you
    need it.
</p>

<pre><code class="java">
public static String postRequest(String url, String params){
    String response = "";

    try{
        response = Request.Post(url)
                .bodyString(params, ContentType.DEFAULT_TEXT)
                .execute().returnContent().asString();
    }catch(IOException ex){
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return response;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This method is written in much the same way as the get method with only a few differences. First, the method calls
    are on separate lines which is a matter of formatting. It can be easier to read chained method calls if they
    are on separate lines and this is still valid syntax. Second, there is a call to bodyString which adds our params to
    the POST request in the format expected by the server (The format used by HTTP).
</p>

<p>
    Most of this code will be the same every time you use this method, but you must specify the content type to match
    the type of information being sent. When we start sending JSON strings in HTTP POST requests we will change this
    value to ContentType.APPLICATION_JSON. This will tell the server how to handle the request. If the wrong content
    type is used the request might not be handled as expected.
