== Academic Integrity


CSE Department Academic Integrity Policy: <a
        href="http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/undergrad/policy_academic.php">
    http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/undergrad/policy_academic.php</a>

<br/><br/>

All submitted work must be of your own creation and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
any submission is very similar to code that has been submitted by another student
or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their code with other students so they can copy. If two
submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students are
    in
    violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
<br/><br/>
All violations will result in:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <div class="text-center alert alert-danger">
            <h3 style="color:red">An F in CSE115.</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-8"></div>
</div>
<br/>
It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
have been caught.

<br/><br/>
Examples of acceptable behavior:
<ul>
    <li>Discussing an assignment with your classmates and brainstorming abstract solutions, then writing
        code independently.
    </li>
    <li>Searching the Internet for supplementary material on the homework topics.</li>
    <li>Asking the teaching staff for clarification on a homework question.</li>
</ul>


Examples of <b>un</b>acceptable behavior:
<ul>
    <li>Submitting code that you did not write.</li>
    <li>Allowing another student to see your code for an assignment.</li>
    <li>Collaborating with another student to write code together for an assignment.</li>
    <li>Allowing another student to access your code. (Example: Do not host your code in a public
        repository)
    </li>
    <li>Copying a large amount of code found on the Internet into your submission.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you plan on cheating, plan on taking this course again.

<div><h4>Concepts</h4></div>

The course will be comprised of the following 12 concepts in this order. You are expected to understand each of these
concepts and apply them to solve real-world problems.
<br/>
<ol>
    <li>Variables</li>
    <li>Control Flow</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>Data Structures</li>
    <li>Files</li>
    <li>Algorithms</li>
    <li>Classes</li>
    <li>Libraries</li>
    <li>Networking</li>
    <li>Javascript Object Notation (JSON)</li>
    <li>Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)</li>
    <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<div><h4>Concept Comprehension</h4></div>

<p>
    <b>
        240 points
    </b>
</p>

<p>
    A maximum of 20 points can be earned for each concept by demonstrating a basic understanding of the material. For
    each concept there are 3 different ways to earn these points with a total of 45 points available allowing for
    flexibility in how you earn these points. No extra credit will be awarded for scoring more than 20 points on a
    concept, though you are encouraged to complete all 45 points as the additional practice will help you with the
    labs and homework.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Lecture Questions (15 points):</b> Most lectures will include programming questions to be solved and
        submitted before the end of lecture (11:50 am). Time will be given during each lecture to complete these
        questions. In a typical week, each lecture will contain 5 points worth of questions. To earn these points
        you must bring a laptop to class. If bringing a laptop to class is too restrictive for any reason, you can
        complete 20 points from the problem sets to earn full credit for concept comprehension.
    </li>
    <li><b>Problem Set (15 points):</b> Each concept will have a corresponding problem set that is due the following
        Monday at 11:00 am. Problem sets consist of 15 short questions worth 1 point each.
    </li>
    <li><b>Advanced Problem Set (15 points):</b> Each of the 12 concepts will have a corresponding advanced problem
        set that is due at the end of the semester. These problem sets will contain fewer, and more difficult,
        questions than the standard problem sets (typically 5 questions worth 3 points each).
        All 12 difficult problem sets are due at the end of the semester to allow students to recover their grade even
        if they don't understand each concept during the week it's covered.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <b>Student expectations:</b> It is expected that everyone in the class will earn 240 points for concept
    comprehension. In doing so, all students are expected to have a basic understanding of each concept after the week
    it has been covered.
</p>

<hr/>

<div><h4>Labs</h4></div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">Lab attendance is required.
</div>
<p>
    <b>
        240 points
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    There will be 13 graded labs throughout the semester each worth 20 points. Your lowest lab grade will be dropped
    making a total of 240 points for labs. Each lab will include a demonstration of the concept from the previous week applied to a real-world problem followed
    by a similar problem to be solved independently. The course staff will assist you while you work on the independent
    problem by answering conceptual questions, but will not provide the solution.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Student expectations:</b> It will be assumed that all students have gained a basic understanding of the concept
    through the concept comprehension assignments before lab begins. The course staff will rely on this understanding
    and focus on interesting applications of each concept.
</p>

<hr/>

<div><h4>Homework</h4></div>
<p>
    <b>
        160 points
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    There will be 4 homework assignments in this course worth 40 points each. These assignments will be completed
    outside of lecture and lab and will be more complex than any other part of the course. Each homework is designed
    to simulate a problem that may be faced in the real world and will require intuition and creativity to solve.
    Preparing students to solve these problems is the primary objective of the course. Any student who can complete all
    4 homework assignments will be well prepared for success in an age based on computers.

{#    This is where it gets real. You are expected to write a program that will solve a specific#}
{#    problem, which is the reason to study computer science. Computers are tools that we use to make ours lives easier.#}
{#    Can you use this tool to make your life easier?#}
</p>

<p>
    <b>Student expectations:</b> For each homework students will be expected to apply and combine all concepts covered
    in lab prior to the deadline for the homework. To complete each homework students are required to think critically
    and discover ways to combine concepts that have not necessarily been explained by the course staff.
</p>

{#<p>#}
{#    Each homework will also contain challenge points. These points are optional and are meant for those seeking an#}
{#    additional challenge that exceeds the expectations of the course. To earn these points you may be challenged by the#}
{#    course staff to explain your code. If you are unable to convince the staff member that you understand your code#}
{#    these points will be revoked.#}
{#</p>#}

<hr/>

<div><h4>Community Points</h4></div>
<p>
    <b>
        20 points
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    You can earn up to 20 points for participating in the technical community at UB. You'll earn 10 points each for any
    of the following activities.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Joining a Technical Club:</b> There are a variety of technical clubs here at UB. Most notably in CSE is ACM.
        Get to know your fellow students while earning a few points!
    </li>
    <li><b>Attend a Technical Talk:</b> Throughout the semester the course staff will announce talks that are eligible
        for community points.
    </li>
    <li><b>Attend a Tutorial or Workshop:</b> ACM members, TA's, and other students often hold tutorials on
        topics that don't get the attention they deserve inside the classroom. Tutorials in the past have included
        mobile app development, coding interview prep, how to get an internship, and many more.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    An activity can be repeated twice to earn 20 points, but total community points are capped at 20.
</p>

<hr/>

<div><h4>Final Exam</h4></div>
<p>
    <b>
        100 points
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    There will only be one exam in the semester which is scheduled during finals week.
</p>

<hr/>

<div class="alert alert-warning">No late assignments will be accepted. Late submissions will result in a grade
    of 0.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">The course staff reserve the right to challenge any points earned by any student. If
    presented with a challenge, the student must demonstrate an understanding of their own code or the points will be
    revoked. Challenges will be made at the discretion of the course staff.
