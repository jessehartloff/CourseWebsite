<h4>
    With a large part of her job being automated Sally has found herself with a lot of free time at work. Her boss
    regularly asks her to process more trades which she handles with ease using your custom software.
</h4>
<h4>
    With Sally's new found time she has been listening to a great deal of music and is constantly looking for new songs
    to
    enjoy. She has
    time to browse the Internet looking for suggestions, but she hasn't found a music site that she really likes. Most
    of them
    are filled with ads, terrible recommendations, and 12 year old mentalities. Sally believes there should be a better
    way for people to share opinions about music and decided to do something about it. Sally's
    co-workers are also getting suspicious about her abundance of free time. Solving this music problem will
    be useful while making it look like she's working.

<h4>
    Inspired by the programs you've written, Sally decides to learn how to program and write her own software that will
    allow us to share songs with her. She worked through a few tutorials on web development and wrote an API for this
    purpose. Her API allows us to recommend songs and rate songs submitted by others. Since Sally wants to listen to the
    full songs her API requires a YouTube video for each recommended song.

<h4>
    This API serves its purpose, but some programming skill are needed in order to use it properly. Sally is hosting the
    API on
    her server, but it is up to you to write the client software to interact with the API. Sally has sent API keys to
    select people which are required to share songs and ratings. With this API, your API key, and your new
    programming skills you can share your song recommendations and process the results to find the best music
    recommendations.

== Problem Definitions

<p>
    Specific details on what needs to be completed for the assignment are provided as comments in the handout code:
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://autograder.cse.buffalo.edu/courses/cse115-s17/assessments/homework3musicratings">Autolab</a>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/hartloff/MusicRatings">Repository</a>
</p>

<p>
    This homework is correlated with Lab 10: <a href="https://goo.gl/I44oPz">Lab 10</a>.
</p>

== The API

<p>
    This API serves as a way for the everyone in the class to used a shared database. The API handles all the database
    interactions and exposes the following functionality through HTTP requests.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    GET / (<a href="http://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/musicRatings">http://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/musicRatings</a>)
</p>

<p>
    The API contains minimal documentation at its root url above.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    GET /getAllSongs (<a href="http://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/musicRatings/getAllSongs">http://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/musicRatings/getAllSongs</a>)
</p>

<p>
    Making a GET request to /getAllSongs will return every song and rating that has been added using the API. Since
    this is a GET request it can easily be accessed through a web browser by clicking the link. This will also show
    the format used to return the information which will need to be parsed. For this assignment you will make requests
    to
    /getAllSongs and process the returned data.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    POST /addSong (<a href="http://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/musicRatings/addSong">http://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/musicRatings/addSong</a>)
</p>

<p>
    Use /addSong to add a new song to the API's database. Check the documentation to see an example of the JSON format
    used to add a song. Any song added must have a valid
    <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/54443/format-for-id-of-youtube-video">YouTube video ID</a>
    (this is not the YouTube link) of a video
    for the song. To add songs you must use the API key that has been emailed to you.
</p>

<p>
    You will add songs as part of lab 10 (<a href="https://goo.gl/I44oPz">goo.gl/I44oPz</a>). This lab has been released
    and can be
    completed before its designated lab section.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    POST /rateSong (<a href="http://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/musicRatings/rateSong">http://fury.cse.buffalo.edu/musicRatings/rateSong</a>)
</p>

<p>
    Use /rateSong to add rating to a song added by someone other than yourself (you rate your own songs when you add
    them). Check the documentation to see an example of the JSON format
    used to rate a song. Songs are identified by their YouTube ID's so there is no need to resend the title and artist
    while rating a song. To add songs you must use the API key that has been emailed to you.
</p>

<p>
    You will rate songs as part of lab 10 (<a href="https://goo.gl/I44oPz">goo.gl/I44oPz</a>). This lab has been
    released and can be
    completed before its designated lab section.
