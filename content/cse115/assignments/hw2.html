== Sally's new job

{% load staticfiles %}

<br/>

<h4>
    Thanks to your help, Sally was able to find the perfect balance in her life throughout her 4 years in college. She
    tested many different scenarios before finding a lifestyle that she can enjoy while leaving enough time to do well
    in her classes.

{#    Thanks to your help, Sally was able to find the right balance between work, school, eating, drinking, sleeping, and#}
{#    relaxing and has been hired by a major investing firm.#}
{#</h4>#}

<h4>
    By living this lifestyle Sally was able to find her dream job at a major investing firm. Sally is excited to start
    her new job and start cashing those big paychecks! While transitioning to the working world Sally plans to make
    minor adjustments to her lifestyle, but she's confident that she doesn't have to make any sacrifices in her
    personal life.

<h4>
    Just as Sally is getting comfortable in her new position, her boss asks her to review every trade made at the firm
    throughout 2016 for three major stocks in the tech sector (AAPL, GOOG, and MSFT) and compute the firms return on
    investment (ROI) from trading these stocks. While Sally is excited to find this ROI, she is not looking forward to
    processing the 1000+ trades that have been made in 2016. Computing the return on all these trades will require
    significant overtime which will disrupt the balanced lifestyle Sally has been enjoying. Since Sally is a
    salaried employee this also means she'll receive the same pay even though she'll be working more hours.

<h4>
    Knowing that her boss will likely have similar tasks for her in the future, Sally decides she wants software that
    will automate this process. Sally hasn't studied much programming, but she knows investing and wrote an outline of a
    java
    program that will process the data. She converted all the
    trades to csv files separated by trader, assembled all the historic prices for the relevant stocks, and wrote
    some testing code. She also wrote descriptions of everything that the
    software needs to do, but she's not sure how to complete the methods described. If you help Sally with this
    software, she will help you organize your finances and begin investing in your future.

    Can you help Sally finish this program?
