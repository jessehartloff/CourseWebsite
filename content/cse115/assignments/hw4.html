== Sally's Vacation

{% load staticfiles %}

<h4>
    Sally, after her hard work and contributions to the company, accumulated a lot of paid vacation days! She thinks
    it’s a good time take a break from work and travel somewhere cool before she conquers another one of her company’s
    big problems.

<h4>
    Sally made a good chunk of change, so money is no object, but she only has a limited amount of time. She wants to
    find the perfect vacation spot to spend her first vacation since starting her job!

<h4>
    She thought the music collections software she wrote a while back worked really well! The amount of feedback she got
    from her co-workers were phenomenal, so she modified the old code a little and repurposed it.
</h4>

<h4>
    She has to fill out a ton of paperwork to get her vacation time, so she’s hoping you can help her with creating a
    user-friendly application using her new API. Can you help Sally out with her idea?
