== Academic Integrity

<br/>
CSE Department Academic Integrity Policy: <a href="http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/undergrad/policy_academic.php">http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/undergrad/policy_academic.php</a>

<br/><br/>
Course Academic Integrity Policy: Do not represent work as your own if you did not create it.
<br/><br/>
All violations will be result in:
<br/><br/>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <div class="text-center alert alert-danger">
            <h3 style="color:red">An F in CSE442.</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-8"></div>
</div>
<br/>
It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
have been caught.

<br/><br/>
Examples of acceptable behavior:
<ul>
    <li>Searching the Internet for coding help and examples.</li>
    <li>Using libraries in your project.</li>
    <li>Expanding an existing project as your course project.</li>
    <li>Having people outside the group contribute to your project.</li>
</ul>


Examples of <b>un</b>acceptable behavior:
<ul>
    <li>Copying a large amount of code into your project without crediting the source.</li>
    <li>Allowing someone outside your group to write code for your project and representing it as the groups
        work.
    </li>
    <li>Violating the licensing agreement of publicly available code.</li>
    <li>Breaking laws.</li>
</ul>


== Slack

<p>
    We will use the following Slack team extensively throughout this course:
</p>
<h4>
    <a href=" https://cse-software.slack.com/signup">https://cse-software.slack.com/</a>
</h4>
<p>
    It is highly recommended that you install a Slack app and turn on notifications.
</p>

== Course Structure


<div class="alert alert-info">
    The value of this course largely depends on your choices. Make the most of it.
</div>

<p>
    The intent of this course is to help bridge the gap between academia and industry by giving students experience
    working as groups of software engineers while they develop and deploy working software. The course is open-ended as
    students are free to choose their own groups and projects. The course primarily takes place in a lab
    environment while students work on their projects and meet with the course staff at the group level as opposed to
    lectures at the class level.
</p>

<p>The open-ended structure of this course allows students to create their own experience. It is assumed that all
    students
    entering this course are competent programmers and are ready to apply and combine their skills to produce a quality
    software product. The role of the course and course staff is to assist the students while they navigate a large
    software engineering project and learn how to collaborate
    effectively. Course staff can be viewed as consultants and will tend to give advice rather than instruction.
    Projects
    are controlled and managed by the groups. Groups are free to ignore any advice given by the course staff, as long as
    the grading outlines are satisfied. For example, if a member of the course staff recommends using Java for your
    project, feel free to use python instead without recourse. However if a member of the course staff says you
    haven't done enough to justify completing a task and you don't finish it your grade will suffer.
</p>


== Grading

<br/>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    There is no curve for this course. Letter grades are determined by an absolute scale.
</div>

<p>
    Final letter grades will be determined by the following cutoffs:
</p><br/>

<table class="table table-bordered table-skinny">
    <tr>
        <td>77 - 80</td>
        <td>A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>76</td>
        <td>A-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>75</td>
        <td>B+</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>74</td>
        <td>B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>73</td>
        <td>B-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>72</td>
        <td>C+</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>71</td>
        <td>C</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>70</td>
        <td>C-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><70</td>
        <td>F</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br/>

== Group Project (50 Points)


<p>
    The course will primarily consist of a semester-long group project. The project will be graded throughout the
    semester during group formation, 5 sprints, and a final presentation. The 5 sprints follow the scrum methodology of
    software engineering and are intended to promote steady progress throughout the semester. Each sprint is 3 weeks
    long with sprint 1 starting on the first day of class.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Group Formation (2 points)</li>
    <li>Sprint 1 (4 points)</li>
    <li>Sprint 2 (8 points)</li>
    <li>Sprint 3 (8 points)</li>
    <li>Sprint 4 (8 points)</li>
    <li>Sprint 5 (16 points)</li>
    <li>Presentation (4 points)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Specific breakdowns for each point can be found in the description for each component.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <b>Meetings:</b> Groups will have required meetings throughout the semester and will keep track of the minutes for
    each meeting. The
    required meetings include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Weekly group meetings</li>
    <li>Weekly group meetings with the groups TA</li>
    <li>Meeting with the course instructor at least once per sprint</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Each group will be assigned a TA and will meet with the same TA weekly throughout the semester.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
    <b>Videos:</b> Each sprint will end with a short video demo of your software posted to YouTube. These videos
    should be made to appeal to a wide audience and should not be technical nor should they show any
    code. The specific nature of
    these videos are largely dependent on the specific project and should be appropriate for your
    software. Examples of videos can be found on the project page from a previous version of this course
    <a href="http://ub-cse.github.io/CSE442-Fall2015-Projects.html">
        http://ub-cse.github.io/CSE442-Fall2015-Projects.html</a>. (Note: Not all videos fit the criteria given
    as the requirements were different in Fall 2015 than they are in Fall 2016)
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <b>Presentations:</b> Near the end of the semester all groups will present their software to the class. The last 2
    weeks of scheduled lecture time and the final exam time will be used for these presentation. Presentation should be
    appropriate for a technical audience.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <b>Deployment: </b> By the end of the semester, projects must be made publicly available on the Internet for
    anyone interested in using it. What a deployment entails will vary depending on the project, but will fall into two
    main categories, monetized and open-source. If you choose to monetize, interested investors
    and/or customers must have a way to give you money by the end of the semester to earn full credit for
    deployment. If your group chooses not to monetize, the project must be open-source and available on GitHub in
    addition to deploying the finished software.
</p>

<p>
    To be considered deployed, someone with no programming experience must be able to access your software.
</p>

<p>
    Examples of what can be accepted for deployment if your group chooses to monetize include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Release your software for sale on a publicly available platform (ex. Steam)</li>
    <li>Start a crowd funding campaign (ex. KickStarter)</li>
    <li>Deliver a VC pitch to potential investors</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Examples of what can be accepted for deployment if your group chooses <b>not</b> to monetize include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Host your software for free on a publicly available platform (ex. Kongregate)</li>
    <li>Host your software as a stand-alone web app</li>
    <li>Submit a research paper based on results produced by your software to a research conference or
        journal
    </li>
    <li>Host binaries for simple installation on Windows, OSX, and Ubuntu. Having users install from your source code is
        not acceptable.
    </li>
</ul>


= Community (20 Points)

<p>
    Collaborating and networking with other technical individuals and communities is an increasingly critical aspect of
    being a software engineer, or working in any technical field. Today's software systems are too large and complex for
    a single developer to understand requiring effective communication and collaboration between individuals and teams.
    This portion of the course will give you experience working with others outside of your group. There are many ways
    to earn these points outlined in the community section and each student can choose their own path to 20 points.
    There are far more than 20 points available, but a maximum of 20 points can be awarded for this section.
</p>


= Philosophy (10 Points)

<p>
    This course will also explore a few non-technical aspects of software engineering. The philosophy assignments will
    occur during lecture meetings and will include a class discussion/debate about the topic as well as a submission
    including
    your thoughts on the topic. There will be no right or wrong answers in this section as we discuss topics such as
    ethics and the impact of software on society.
</p>

<br/>
= Grading Notes

All assignments are subject to the following conditions.

<ul>
    <li>No late submissions will be accepted. Late submissions will result in a grade of 0.</li>
    <li>Much of the grading in this course is subjective and final grading decisions are made at the
        discretion of the course instructor.
    </li>
</ul>
