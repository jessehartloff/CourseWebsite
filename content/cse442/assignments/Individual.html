<p>
    The individual assessment
    will be largely open-ended with the potential to earn up to 32 points. There
    will be a variety of opportunities to earn these points throughout the semester and there will be
    choices in how these points can be earned, but the total individual points will be capped at 32.
</p>

<p>
    A sample of ways to earn these points is given below. You are encouraged to add to this list with your
    own suggestions that fit the criteria that it shows your ability write software and interact with others
    who write software. Point values may vary depending on activity with a
    default value of 8.
    Activities can be repeated multiple times for credit but no more than 16 points can come from the same
    activity.
</p>

    <li>Contribute code to an open-source project</li>
    <li>Complete coding assignments (Will be announced when available)</li>
    <li>Interview for a software development internship or full-time position</li>
    <li>Receive an offer for a software development internship or full-time position</li>
    <li>Host a software-related video to YouTube</li>
    <li>Complete a software development internship (points awarded retroactively)</li>
    <li>Complete a software project outside of coursework that is substantial enough to put on your resume

== Interview Questions (8 Points)

{% load staticfiles %}

<ul>
    <li>
        (C++) Find the middle element of a singly-linked list in a single pass. If the array has even size return the
        average of the two middle elements. (<a href="{% static 'courses/interviewQ1handout.tar' %}">handout</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
        (Java) Write a function to find an element in a sorted array of unknown size. The function must run in
        O(log(n)). (<a href="{% static 'courses/interviewQ2handout.tar' %}">handout</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
        (Python) Implement stack that tracks the min value in O(1). In addition to push, pop, and top, the stack should
        have a min function that will return the smallest value in the stack. All 4 functions must run in O(1) time. (<a href="{% static 'courses/Q3.py' %}">handout</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
        (C++) Write a function that takes an int and flips one bit from 0 to 1 to maximize the number of
        consecutive 1’s in in the binary representation of the new int in O(n) time where n is the number of bits
        representing the int. The function will return the new int.
    </li>
</ul>
