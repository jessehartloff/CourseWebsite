    Note: The point distribution for sprint 3 is the same as for Sprint 2 except the version number is "v0.3.0"
</div>


== Group Points

<p>
    The following 4 points are evaluated on a group basis. All members of the group will share the same score for these
    points.
</p>

= Group Communication (1 point)

<p>
    All required meetings have occurred and the minutes for each have been pushed to the group repo in the appropiate
    format and location. For each sprint,
    excluding sprint 1, this will include 3 weekly meetings with the groups TA, 3 weekly group meetings without course
    staff, and 1 meeting with the course instructor. Minutes for all 7 required meetings must appear in the group repo.
    If a
    single meeting is missed by the entire group, or the minutes are not uploaded, this point will not be awarded.
</p>
<p>
    If the quality of the meetings or minutes are poor this points might not be awarded, but more importantly the
    minutes
    will
    be used to track any issues that the group members have been facing. There are often unforeseen issues and
    complications
    while writing code that can turn a 10 minute task into a week-long time sink. If a task is not completed by the end
    of a sprint, but there are well documented complications that appear in the minutes throughout the sprint, you can
    potentially get credit for an incomplete task at the discretion of the course instructor. If a task is not completed
    and there has
    been no communication about a complication, no credit will be given for the task.
</p>

= Group Version Control (1 point)

<p>
    The group has been properly applying the branching model used for this course. Specifically, the group has a master
    and development branch which the group members only merge into and never push to directly. Group members create
    feature branches off of develop to work on their tasks and merge the branch into develop when the task is complete.
</p>
<p>
    This point can still be awarded even if a few group members are violating the branching model. If the group as a
    whole is not implementing the branching model this point will not be awarded.
</p>

= Group Task Completion / Version Release (1 point)

<p>
    The next working version of the software has been merged from develop to master and is tagged as release "v0.3.0" in
    GitHub. The software must have some functionality added since the previous sprint. If at least
    one group member completed all their tasks and merged them into master then this point will be awarded.
</p>

= YouTube Video (1 point)

<p>
    Upload a demo of your software to YouTube. This video must give an accurate view of the current state of your
    project and show the running software. This video will be directed towards a non-technical audience and will show
    them the current working functionality that has been implemented. You should not be scrolling through code in this
    video.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 2 minutes to get credit. This will be strictly enforced. The goal is
    to quickly communicate the status of your product to the end users.
</p>

== Individual Points

<p>
    The following 4 points are all evaluated on an individual basis.
</p>

= Individual Communication (1 point)

<p>
    Effectively communicate with your groups and course staff throughout the sprint. This includes attending and
    participating in meetings,
    being responsive on Slack, keeping the group posted on task progress, etc.
</p>

= Individual Version Control (1 point)

<p>
    Development has been made on feature branches and are merged into develop when a task is completed. Work has been
    committed and pushed on a
    regular basis with
    meaningful commit messages throughout the sprint. A good rule of thumb is to push your changes at the end of each
    coding session. This point will not be awarded if little/no work is
    completed (ie. a group member who makes regular commits with no substance will not be awarded this point).
</p>

<p></p>

= Individual Task Progress (1 point)

<p>
    Substantial progress has been made on the assigned task(s). This must be reflected by regular commits to the repo on
    a feature branch, discussion of the progress in group meetings, and an understanding of the technical aspects of the
    task. If no task
    is assigned in GitHub, this point will not be awarded.
</p>

<p>
    Each group member must have a task(s) assigned to them using GitHub's issue tracker. Individual task points will be
    determined by the progress made by each group member on their assigned task(s) for the sprint. Individual tasks must
    be technical in nature. No individual credit will be awarded for non-technical tasks completed
    as part of the project.
</p>

<p>
    While assigning tasks you should be aware of the dependencies between tasks. If your task depends on a another group
    member finishing
    their work first you may not be able to complete your task in time if your group member doesn't complete theirs.
    This will not be allowed as an excuse for not finishing your task and it should be a goal of the group to divide the
    tasks such that they can all be completed in parallel.
</p>


= Individual Task Completion (1 point)


{#<div class="alert alert-info">#}
{#    Individual tasks must be technical in nature. No individual credit will be awarded for non-technical tasks completed#}
{#    as part of the project.#}
{#</div>#}
<p>
    Assigned task(s) for this sprint have been completed and merged into develop. Develop must be stable after the
    merge. If no task
    is assigned in GitHub, this point will not be awarded.
</p>
<p>
    In certain cases this point can be awarded for a task that is not complete and merged into develop. Incomplete tasks
    will only be earn this point if there is substantial evidence that an honest attempt has been made to complete the
    task, but an unforeseen obstacle has prevented its completion. This evidence must appear in the minutes throughout
    the sprint (not just the last week), reports from the TA, and commits early in the sprint. Decisions will
    be made at the discretion of the course instructor.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the task completion points for sprints 2-4 are expected to be the 3 most difficult points to earn in this
    course. Not all points will require the same amount of effort to earn.
</p>
