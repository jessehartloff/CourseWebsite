== Properties

{% load staticfiles %}

<p>
Variables have several properties:
<ul>
<li>type</li>
<li>name</li>
<li>value</li>
<li>location</li>
<li>scope</li>
<li>lifetime</li>
</ul>

To fully understand how variables work in a computer program it is necessary to have a firm grasp on each of these properties.

</p>


== Type

<p>
From the perspective of programmer the type of a variable determines
the set of values which can be assigned to it.  The type also
determines the internal representation of those values, including the
encoding used and the number of bits allocated for the representation.
</p>

<p>
Consider the Java type named int.  As we know the values of type int
are whole numbers: values like 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, etc.  It turns
out that there is a limited range of values that are representable as
an int: -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.  (Why those specific values?
That's another DeepDive topic: understanding the two's complement
representation.)
</p>

<p>A value of type int occupies 32 bits of memory and is encoded using
the two's complement representation. (What are bits?  That's another
DeepDive topic: understanding memory.)  Java has three other types
that use the two's complement encoding: byte, short and long.  Why?
They are different sizes, and so can encode different ranges of
values.  A byte occupies 8 bits, and can represent values from -128 to
+127.  A short occupies 16 bits, and can represent values from -32,768
to +32,767.  A long occupies 64 bits, and can represent values from
-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,80.
</p>

<p>A value of type float or double uses a different encoding to
represent numeric values, called the IEEE754 encoding (named for the
IEEE standard that specifies the encoding).  A float represents values
using 32 bits, whereas a double uses 64 bits.
</p>


== Name

<p>The name of a variable is available in the high-level program.  It
  does not actually exist at runtime.
</p>


== Value

<p>
The value of a variable is what is stored in the variable, encoded as
per the type.
</p>


== Location

<p>
Where in memory the variable exists.
</p>


== Scope

<p>
The textual extent of the variable declaration in the high-level program.
</p>


== Lifetime

<p>
The period of time during the execution of a program that the variable
is actually bound to a location in memory.
